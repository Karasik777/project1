Fun project of me and the boys developing machine learning skills. 

Authors:

part1.py - Basically trying to understand how to add layers
what optimizers to use and how to structure a good model in general. 

parat2.py - With some understanding of what resources to use
go and fetch 5 good models that are able to predict/estimate what 
prime numbers are. 

General approach:

Chekcing the integrity of data by having a primenumbers.csv containing (you guessed it)
prime numbers. Making a local array of 7920 numbers (1000 prime numbers in there), making labels (1 - prime, 0 - other)
after that going ahead and making a model. The goal is to get a model which can recreate the labels array 
and correctly label prime numbers out of the 8000 element array. 

We had fun, ML  is fun, I am tired, good accuracy of models therefore I am happy.

Cool things!
Peace!
